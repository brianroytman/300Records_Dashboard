# InvsbleMusicDashboard

Web application developed for Invsble Music - an artist management and music consulting services company. The dashboard provides tools to automate:

1) generating artist metadata XMLs for submission to digital streaming providers prior to single and ep/album releases (live with YouTube)
2) creating and managing copyright takedown claims
3) internal scheduling for artist releases and claims on a shared calendar
4) measuring artist asset performance (e.g. YouTube videos) across various social media platforms and digital streaming providers. 


Currently in use with Operations employees at 300 Entertainment (Warner Music Group) to support artist metadata submission workflow.
